# Community Guidelines

Like any other open-source project, this project is made up of a diverse group of individuals from around the globe who work on every facet of its goals. 
We take pride in being inclusive and treating everyone with respect, 
regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or similar personal characteristics. 
We love the diverse opinions of our contributors and maintainers; therefore, we expect you to.

The subsequent subsections go into further detail about our community's guidelines and standards.

## 1. Be more considerate, kind, constructive, and helpful

We want to create a community where everyone feels welcome and receives support from people of different backgrounds and identities. 
Thus, we believe we can achieve this by building a positive, welcoming environment where everyone feels safe to share ideas, thoughts, and feedback. 
As you contribute, try to be supportive, respect individual opinions, and report inappropriate posts if needed.

## 2. Expected Behavior and choice of words matters

We are a very diverse community. Thus, it would help if you acted professionally. 
Therefore, you are to work in a manner thatÂ includes but is not restricted to:

1. Don't use violent threats or language directed against another individual.
2. Consider collaboration before conflict.
3. No discriminatory jokes, insults, and language. This includes discriminatory behavior and speech, especially racist, homophobic, sexist, or demeaning words.
4. Do not post sexually explicit or violent material.
5. No unwelcome sexual attention.
6. Do not advocate for or encourage any of the above behavior.
7. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
8. Participate authentically and actively to contribute to this community's health and longevity.

Be mindful of your fellow participants and please report any cases of harassment by alerting community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

## 3. Disagreements 

Disagreements are bound to happen, primarily because of the community's diversity. The strength of the project comes from its diversity. It is, however, important that we resolve disagreements constructively. Another individual having a different perspective or viewpoint on issues doesn't mean they're wrong. Don't forget that it is human to err, and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.
