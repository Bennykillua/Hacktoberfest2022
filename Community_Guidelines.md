# Community Guidelines

Like any other open-source project, this project is made up of a diverse group of individuals from around the globe who work on every facet of its goals. 
We take pride in being inclusive and treating everyone with respect, 
regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or similar personal characteristics. 
We love the diverse opinions of our contributors and maintainers; therefore, we expect you to.

The subsequent subsections go into further detail about our community's guidelines and standards.
