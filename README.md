## Getting Started ü•≥

We believe we can build a welcoming and inclusive community if we adopt these behaviours:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing opinions, perspectives, viewpoints and experiences.
- Giving and accepting constructive feedback.
- Attempting collaboration before conflict.
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our actions and mistakes, and learning from the experience.
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals but for the community.
